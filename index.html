HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. It provides a structure and formatting for the content of a webpage. HTML uses tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms.

Here are some key points about HTML:

Structure: HTML uses a hierarchical structure composed of nested elements. The document starts with the <html> tag and is divided into <head> and <body> sections.

Tags: HTML tags are used to mark up elements within the document. They are enclosed in angle brackets, such as <tagname>. Some common tags include <h1> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <img> for images, and <a> for links.

Attributes: HTML tags can have attributes that provide additional information or functionality. Attributes are placed within the opening tag and provide values, such as href for specifying a link URL or src for specifying the source of an image.

Text Formatting: HTML provides tags for formatting text, including <strong> for bold, <em> for italic, <u> for underline, and <br> for line breaks.

Links and Navigation: HTML allows you to create hyperlinks using the <a> tag. Links can point to other web pages, files, or specific sections within a page using anchors (<a href="#section">).

Images: You can include images in HTML using the <img> tag. The src attribute specifies the image source (URL or file path), and additional attributes control size, alt text, and other properties.

Lists: HTML supports ordered lists (<ol>) and unordered lists (<ul>) for creating bullet-pointed or numbered lists. List items are marked with <li> tags.

Forms: HTML provides form elements (<form>) for capturing user input, such as text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus. Form data can be submitted to a server for processing.

Semantics: HTML5 introduced semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, and others to give more meaning and structure to the content.

CSS and JavaScript: HTML can be styled using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to control the appearance of elements. JavaScript can be used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.

HTML is the backbone of the web and is essential for creating web content. It is supported by all major web browsers and serves as the foundation for building interactive and visually appealing websites.
